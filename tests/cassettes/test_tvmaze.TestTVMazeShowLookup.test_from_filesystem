        It all comes to a head when Glenn (who helped Rick escape Atlanta) finds that
        the barn is full of walkers. After a heated debate between Shane and Hershel,
        Shane releases the walkers from the barn to be put down. It's here that the

        tracked the car to Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. Noah, who had escaped
        from the hospital, tells them that it is run by a group of corrupt police
        officers led by Dawn. They are using the hospital's scant resources to save
        as many as they come across, but force those that they save to work as nurses
        and other laborers in return. In an attempt to save Beth, Carol is run down
        by a police car and taken to the hospital, where Dawn prohibits Beth from

        Sasha becomes withdrawn after losing her brother. Continuing further down
        their path, the group encounters a lone traveler by the name of Aaron, who
        invites them to his home in Alexandria \u2013 a walled-off community protected
        from walkers. Inside they are met by their leader Deanna Monroe, who offers
        them sanctuary in return for protection. Though the community functions well
        and benefits from solar power and clean water, they lack the necessary training
        to survive outside the walls. During a run, one of Deanna's sons, Aiden, is
        killed and Glenn, Noah and Nicholas are trapped in a revolving door. Though
        Eugene manages to lead the walkers outside away using the vans radio, Nicholas
        panics and abandons Glenn and Noah, who is devoured by the walkers. Deanna
        assigns members of Rick's group to different roles throughout the community
        and convinces others within her inner circle that Rick's group is critical
        to their survival. The idea doesn't sit well with some of Alexandria's inhabitants.
        Rick's group discovers evidence that a savage group of human survivors known
        as the Wolves are located nearby.</p><p>Rick discovers that Jessie Anderson's
        husband Pete who suffers from alcoholism has been abusing her, and under Deanna's
        request, kills him during a violent episode in which Pete accidentally kills
        Deanna's husband. The rest of the community witnesses everything in horror.
        Meanwhile, Rick's group has been followed by Morgan Jones, the first survivor
        Rick encountered after waking up from his coma. Morgan, who was hot on Rick's
        trail earlier, discovered the map that Abraham left at the church and the
        note addressed to Rick, and has been following them since. He walks up to
        Rick just as he shoots Pete.</p>\",\"_links\":{\"self\":{\"href\":\"http://api.tvmaze.com/seasons/267\"}}},{\"id\":8261,\"url\":\"http://www.tvmaze.com/seasons/8261/the-walking-dead-season-6\",\"number\":6,\"name\":\"\",\"episodeOrder\":16,\"premiereDate\":\"2015-10-11\",\"endDate\":\"2016-04-03\",\"network\":{\"id\":20,\"name\":\"AMC\",\"country\":{\"name\":\"United
