        as well as the elementary school niece of their faculty adviser, were bestowed
        with supernatural powers. The boy in the club, Ando Jurai, became able to
        produce black flames. The girls acquired a variety of powerful abilities:
        Tomoyo could slow, speed, or stop time, Hatoko could control the five elements
        (earth, water, fire, wind, light), little Chifuyu could create things, and
        Sayumi could repair objects or heal living things. However, since they gained
        these powers, nothing has really changed in their everyday life. Why have
        they been given these powers in the first place? Will the heroic fantasy life
        they imagined these powers would bring ever actually arrive?\",\n      \"seriesName\":
