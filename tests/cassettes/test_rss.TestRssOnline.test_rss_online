        <description>After an extensive review process and passing a major development
        milestone, NASA is ready to proceed with final design and construction of
        its next Mars rover, currently targeted to launch in the summer of 2020 and
        arrive on the Red Planet in February 2021.</description>\n <enclosure url=\"http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/1x1_cardfeed/public/thumbnails/image/m2020-rover-cad.jpg?itok=olhE5sKr\"

        <a href=\"a/photogallery\">photo gallery system</a>). Neither are available
        to the public (unless you are a close friend or pay us lots of money).</p>\n\t\t<p>Both
        of these systems were developed internally for two reasons:</p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Solve
        a problem of our own (publishing a weblog or photos)</li>\n\t\t<li>Play/experiment
        with technology</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t\t<p>The photo resizing/manipulation code
        developed with modest intentions has since proven valuable in other (commercial)
        projects. Similarly, the abstraction of layout/design from the system in the
        weblog platform is proving valuable in other projects.</p>\n\t\t<p>We have
        toyed with the idea of releasing either or both systems. However, both systems
        rely heavily on our own in-house proprietary PHP development platform (affectionately
        called the PSeries). For now, at least, neither system will be released to
        the public. In the meantime, we&#8217;ll be releasing a few bits and pieces
        that we are able and willing to share.</p>\n\t\t<p>Another option we&#8217;ve
        toyed with is selling either service (or both together) on a subscription
        basis. However, we&#8217;re not sure we want to get into an end-user support
        situation. There aren&#8217;t that many of us here and it&#8217;s not really

        of these systems were developed internally for two reasons:</p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Solve
        a problem of our own (publishing a weblog or photos)</li>\n\t\t<li>Play/experiment
        with technology</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t\t<p>The photo resizing/manipulation code
        developed with modest intentions has since proven valuable in other (commercial)
        projects. Similarly, the abstraction of layout/design from the system in the
        weblog platform is proving valuable in other projects.</p>\n\t\t<p>We have
        toyed with the idea of releasing either or both systems. However, both systems
        rely heavily on our own in-house proprietary PHP development platform (affectionately
        called the PSeries). For now, at least, neither system will be released to
        the public. In the meantime, we&#8217;ll be releasing a few bits and pieces
        that we are able and willing to share.</p>\n\t\t<p>Another option we&#8217;ve
