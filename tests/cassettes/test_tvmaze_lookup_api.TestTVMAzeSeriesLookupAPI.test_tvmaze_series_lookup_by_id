        a particle accelerator causes a freak storm, CSI Investigator Barry Allen
        is struck by lightning and falls into a coma. Months later he awakens with
        the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move through Central
        City like an unseen guardian angel. Though initially excited by his newfound
        powers, Barry is shocked to discover he is not the only \"meta-human\" who
        was created in the wake of the accelerator explosion -- and not everyone is
        using their new powers for good. Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and dedicates
        his life to protect the innocent. For now, only a few close friends and associates
        know that Barry is literally the fastest man alive, but it won''t be long
