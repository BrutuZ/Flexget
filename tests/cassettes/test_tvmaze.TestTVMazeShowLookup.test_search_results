        is a fiercely engaging and fearlessly twisted series. Chicagoan Frank Gallagher
        is the proud single dad of six smart, industrious, independent kids, who without
        him would be... perhaps better off. When Frank''s not at the bar spending
        what little money they have, he''s passed out on the floor. But the kids have
        found ways to grow up in spite of him. They may not be like any family you
        know, but they make no apologies for being exactly who they are.</p>","updated":1487373839,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/150"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/928422"}},"_embedded":{"seasons":[{"id":683,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/seasons/683/shameless-season-1","number":1,"name":"","episodeOrder":12,"premiereDate":"2011-01-09","endDate":"2011-03-27","network":{"id":9,"name":"Showtime","country":{"name":"United
