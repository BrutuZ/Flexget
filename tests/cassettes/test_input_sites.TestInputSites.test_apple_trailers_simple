        Thwaites) undertakes a thrilling journey to save the world and rescue his
        true love. In order to succeed, he must enlist the help of the powerful god
        Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in an unlikely alliance against Set (Gerard
        Butler), the merciless god of darkness, who has usurped Egypt\u2019s throne,
        plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict.
        As their breathtaking battle against Set and his henchmen takes them into
        the afterlife and across the heavens, both god and mortal must pass tests
        of courage and sacrifice if they hope to prevail in the epic final confrontation.<br

        money to scare a bunch of fans at the local park. Easy money for a weekend
        gig, right? Wrong. When they get there, they meet the woman who runs it, as

        finishing up a long and unsuccessful tour, and are about to call it quits
        when they get an unexpected booking at an isolated, run-down club deep in
        the backwoods of Oregon. What seems merely to be a third-rate gig escalates
        into something much more sinister when they witness an act of violence backstage
        that they weren\u2019t meant to see. Now trapped backstage, they must face
        off against the club\u2019s depraved owner, Darcy Banker (Stewart), a man
        who will do anything to protect the secrets of his nefarious enterprise. But
        while Darcy and his henchmen think the band will be easy to get rid of, The
        Ain\u2019t Rights prove themselves much more cunning and capable than anyone
        expected, turning the tables on their unsuspecting captors and setting the
        stage for the ultimate life-or-death showdown.","twitter_message":"Green Room

        New Yorker working in education, who without success in finding love, decides
        now is the time to have a child on her own. But when she meets John Harding
        (Ethan Hawke), an anthropology professor and struggling novelist, Maggie falls

        the help of the powerful god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in an unlikely
        alliance against Set (Gerard Butler), the merciless god of darkness, who has
        usurped Egypt\u2019s throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire
        into chaos and conflict. As their breathtaking battle against Set and his
