=========================
Supported Python versions
=========================

For releases of Python, we aim to support any minor Python versions released in the last 4.5 years
(54 months), as defined in `the EOL schedule for Python`_.

.. _the EOL schedule for Python: https://endoflife.date/python

We define 'support' as testing against each of these versions so that users can be assured they
will not trigger any bugs.

For example, if we made a release tomorrow, weâ€™d look at `the EOL schedule for Python`_ and
support all the versions that fall within a 4.5-year window.
